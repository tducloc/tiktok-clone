# frontend_1

This is a Flutter application project named 'frontend_1'. 

## Description

This project is a clone of the popular social media app TikTok. The goal of this project is to mimic the dynamic and interactive UI of TikTok using Flutter. It includes features such as the scrolling video feed, the like, comment, and share buttons, as well as the bottom navigation bar. Please note that this is a UI clone, so the backend functionalities like actual video uploading, user authentication, etc., are not implemented. This project serves as a great starting point for learning how to create complex UIs in Flutter.
